* Journal club, Haiqing talk about a paper "The genetic landscape of a physical interaction". 
  They use the change of downstream product reads number to measure the transcriptome binding ability,
  and it seems to me not rigorous, however the results are pretty good. 
* modify script to generate tRNA mutated sequences and corresponding fitness.
