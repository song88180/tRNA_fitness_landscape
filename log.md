* Xukang Shen lead Journal Club with the nature paper "RNA velocity of single cells" 

## 9/20/2018
* Drawing figures for sumulated data to see the structure.
* Visit Ding Xinqiang to inquire some machine learning questions.

## 9/19/2018
* Haoxuan lead the lab meeting, talking about his mutation accumulation experiment. Main results: worse the environment is, more likely the cell is going to mutate. Don't know if this character is adaptive or not.
* Try dim_z = 10, train VAE model

## 8/18/2018
* Gaussian process with 1000 high fitness sequences
* Gaussian process with 1000 high fitness + 1000 low fitness sequences

## 9/17/2018
* train 2d VAE model.
* Gaussian process

## 9/16/2018
* ZJU alumni gathering lunch.

## 9/15/2018
* Get some second-handed furnitures.

## 9/14/2018
* Journal club, Haiqing talk about a paper "The genetic landscape of a physical interaction". 
  They use the change of downstream product reads number to measure the transcriptome binding ability,
  and it seems to me not rigorous, however the results are pretty good. 
* modify script to generate tRNA mutated sequences and corresponding fitness.

## 9/13/2018
* modify script to generate tRNA mutated sequences and corresponding fitness.

## 9/12/2018
* Lab meeting, Piaopiao talk about 1. negative effect of changing experiment on dN/dS ratio; 2. Whole genome single deletion fitness landscape experiment. 
* repeat script example

## 9/11/2018
* read paper "Learning protein stability, evolution and fitness landscapes with variational auto-encoder models"
* check in at IC

## 9/10/2018
* read paper "Multi-environment fitness landscapes of a tRNA gene" and "The fitness landscape of a tRNA gene"

## 9/8,9/2018
* settled down

## 9/7/2018
* met professor Zhang
* discuss project with Zhengting

## 9/6/2018
* arrived at UMich
